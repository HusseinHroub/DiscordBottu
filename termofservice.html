<h1>Terms of Service Agreement</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This agreement (the "Agreement") is made between you and the creators of the Valorant Discord Bot (the "Bot"). By using the Bot, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may not use the Bot.</p>
<h2>Description of the Bot</h2>
<p>The Valorant Discord Bot is a tool that stores player statistics such as kills, assists, and KDA. The Bot also announces in-game events in the Discord server, such as a player getting a penta kill or having more than 20 kills in a single game. The Bot can be contacted through commands that display the player's rank in specified metrics, such as player rank for kills or assists.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>The Bot stores player statistics in a secure database. We will not expose player data outside of the Discord server scope and we take appropriate measures to protect the security of the data stored by the Bot.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
<p>The Bot is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We do not guarantee that the Bot will be error-free or that it will meet your expectations. You use the Bot at your own risk.</p>
<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>We are not liable for any damages that may arise from your use of the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to, any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.</p>
<h2>Changes to the Agreement</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time. If we make changes to the Agreement, we will post the updated Agreement on our website and update the "Last Revised" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Bot following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>
<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Bot was created and any applicable federal laws of the United States of America.</p>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
